    <h1>Privacy Information</h1>

    <p>
      The Design Signatures App is privacy-friendly and respects your control of
      your personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data that you create (for example, by tracking a design session) or upload
      to the app does not leave your device. It is stored in your browser's
      local storage and not on any servers. If you choose to share your data
      (e.g., by using the export feature), you can do so through any
      conventional file or image sharing method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your projects can be exported from the app in a
      <a href="https://data.design-awareness.com/" target="_blank">
        standard format</a
      >
      through the "export" feature in the menu visible on all project pages.
    </p>
    <p>You are welcome to modify, build, and host the app yourself.</p>

    <h2>Webfont hosting</h2>
    <p>
      Fonts used in this software are loaded from
      <code>https://rsms.me/inter/</code>, which is distributed by a
      <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank">
        Cloudflare CDN</a
      >
      and hosted by
      <a
        href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#additional-services"
        target="_blank"
      >
        GitHub</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      The hosted Design Signatures App at
      <code>https://app.design-awareness.com/</code>
      also includes an analytics service that has additional privacy
      considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      These privacy-friendly analytics are designed to minimize data collection,
      using the
      <a
        href="https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics"
        target="_blank"
      >
        plausible</a
      >
      software. No personal data is collected. All measurements are carried out
      anonymously and data is aggregated. You are not tracked across devices,
      other sites or apps, or different days. No cookies or any other persistent
      identifiers are used. This analytics option is fully
      <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" target="_blank">GDPR</a> compliant.
    </p>
    <h3>What data we collect</h3>
    <p>
      We use analytics to help us estimate how many people are using the app. We
      collect a single data point each time the app is opened. This includes
      general information about your device type, browser, and how you got to
      the app, if you were linked from somewhere else. These data points are not
      correlated across sessions and do not include any identifying information,
      such as IP, location, or any personal browsing or usage data.
    </p>

    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>
      You are invited to voluntarily leave feedback on the app to help us make
      improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to submit feedback privately through Google Forms, you can use
      the "Send feedback" link in the settings menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to submit feedback publicly or ask a question, you can open an
      issue or discussion on our
      <a
        href="https://github.com/design-awareness/design-signatures-app"
        target="_blank"
        >GitHub repository</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use your feedback to better understand how people are using the app and
      how we can make it better. Feedback you submit through a third-party
      platform is subject to the privacy considerations of that platform.
